Requires PHP with SimpleXML, cURL and Memcached support.

Disclaimer
==========
This is the raw code we're using on our site and it was never intended to
be a generic solution for third parties.

Hence you'll most likely need to modify the HTML and Swedish text in files 
such as frontpage.php, photoset.php and image.php.



Short file description
======================

hdFlickr.php
- PHP class for handling communication with Flickr's API
- Caches request responses (using memcached, defaults to 24h)
- Most API calls return SimpleXML objects or FALSE on error

config.flickr.php
- Settings (API-key, API secret, username)

index.php
- Main file for handling gallery requests
- Initializes memcached
- Initializes Flickr API access (hdFlickr)
- Decides what file to include to handle the request ({frontpage, photoset, image}.php)

frontpage.php
- Lists available gallerys on Flickr
- Included by index.php

photoset.php
- Displays thumbnails of all pictures in a gallery
- Linked to by frontpage.php
- Included by index.php

image.php
- Displays a single picture and links to previous/next pictures
- Displays only public images, not those marked private or for friends/family only
- Linked to from photoset.php
- Included by index.php

refresh.php
- Command line script to refresh request response caches for  changed photosets
- Can also force a refresh of all available photosets if the script is given an argument
- Needed due to aggressive cache defaults in hdFlickr.php ($mc_ttl), 
  especially when photosets are currently being updated (i.e, during events)


Machine tags
============

This gallery supports machine tags.
Encode 'namespace:predicate=value' as 'namespace-predicate-value' in the set parameter.
  Example machine tag: mynamespace:submittedpics=marathon2009
  Example URL: http://example.net/flickr/?set=mynamespace-submittedpics-marathon2009


TODO
====

- AJAX browsing
- Remove debug comments
- White- or black-listing of photos in machine tag-based galleries
